### <p align="center">The ultimate library to complete the 42 Cursus</p>

---
**What is this project about?**</br>
**LIBFT** is a library written in **C** that contains plenty of useful functions. These functions had to be created or recreated, not only to be used along the 42 Cursus but also to learn the basics of programming from the core.</br>

## Biggest Challenges ðŸ’ª:

  In general, there were a lot of interesting challenges to face. Recreating functions from scratch is not a simple task when you are starting to learn how to program.</br></br>
  The most relevant one was the **get_next_line** function, which is quite similar to the **readline** function. This was a project on its own, which I later had to add to this library. 
  The main reason why it became a challenge is that I had to deal with style limitations. These limitations included not having more than 5 functions per file, a maximum of 25 lines per function, and not having more than 2 files for supplementary functions. Additionally, I had to learn about leaks and how important it is to manage memory to avoid any problems in case of a malfunction in your programs or functions.</br></br>
  It was also interesting to learn about header files, their usage and how to create a library, as well as compiling using a **Makefile**.
